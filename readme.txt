Add a contact form link into article text.
For contact forms where the recipient can be chosen in a select box.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to use one contact form for all your contacts? Yet be able to link to a specific contact?
And without modifying the *Contact Form 7* extension?

This little extension guides you to set up *Contact Form 7*, enter the contacts there, and then adds an editor button by which you can link a specific contact form.

**Features:**

* Email adresses are invisible to website visitors (no spam)
* Adds Editor Button to the admin area where links to a contact form can be added or modified
* Contact form links can by styled by CSS
* Translation to German

**Requirements:**

* Contact Form 7 (v3.3 or later): http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/

== Installation ==

1. Install *Contact Form 7* first
1. Create a form containing a select tag:

   `[select* recipient id:recipient "John Doe|jondoe@example.org" "Max Mustermann|maxmustermann@example.org"]`

1. Set Mail option "To:" to `[recipient]` 
1. Install and Activate this plugin
1. Test it: Add this contact form to a page or post, and call it with `#Max+Mustermann` at the end. "Max Mustermann" should be pre-selected now.
1. Configure the parameters: 
  * The URL where the contact form resides (e.g. `/contact/`)
  * An optional prefix to the title attribute that will get created.

== TO DO ==

On Ajax:
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /mnt/web2/c0/81/5436181/htdocs/siegen/wp-admin/includes/plugin.php on line 1290
-> admin_menu hook?

When editing a Link with an "invalid recipient" (form was modified) he should replace the old one nonetheless.

* Currently, only one form can be used (selectable at the settings page)
* The URL could be detected (find all articles containing a contact form, and propose them in a select box)
* When change URL Prefix, at least show a warning that the links need to be updated (load, insert).
* When clicking on a link that has the form on the same page, should it scroll to the form? Currently, it only changes the selected value.

These are limitations that I may (one day, if/when I come to it) adress in future.
So if you're a developer and want to adress them yourself,
go ahead and I will be happy to support you!
